# Tutorial Documentation of Heypi 

## Project Description

Heypi is a project done as an experiment which has a voice chat system that utilizes cloud services to carry out its functions. With the implementation of IOT products such as DHT and light sensors Heypi is able to offer more than just a typical voice chat application. Real time reports of the temperature and light can be seen, in future implementation of heypi we can make both end users of the application understand the other client's environment more.

### 1. Setting up the Raspberri pi

Setting up of the Raspberri pi is rather straight forward.

Do ensure the following sensors, resistors and amount of cables are present before setting up

- 1 x DHT 11 Sensor
- 1 x LED 
- 1 x  MCP3008 ADC
- 1 x  Light sensitive resistor

A fritzing.jpg attached on this github. The exact replication will be required to be setup in order for the application to work without any issues.

### 2. Installation of required Modules

* Required apt-get modules
* Required pip3 modules

### 3. Running the Software

Run the .py application with the following arguments -u Your chosen username -p your chosen password

Do note the passsword and username entered will be used on the web interface later.



### 4. Troubleshooting
